When users go to the QGIS downloads page, they should generally see the download options relevant to their operating system. Windows and MacOS should be able to run the installer that downloads for the selected version and be able to get going (but see any notes on the download page); Linux users should review the instructions available for their specific Linux distribution.\n\n1.1.1 Available Versions\nAt the time of this writing, there are two versions of QGIS readily available, and this general model is how it tends to be set up:\n\nLatest Release, version 3.34, available from the Green Button - this may have some newer features added;\nLong Term Release (“LTR”), version 3.28, in the link directly below the green button - long term releases are maintained with bug-fixes, but not generally new features for 3 release cycles, to focus on stability.\n\nThis tutorial was developed using 3.34, but either version should generally work. (Releases are denoted as x.y.z, where changes in ‘x’ denotes some potentially larger changes in the software, changes in ‘y’ denote additions of features and bug fixes, and changes in ‘z’ generally reflect bug-fixes.)\nShould users need older or development releases for any reason, they can access those through the “All Releases” tab on the webpage.\nNote: Windows users will also notice another download option for the OSGeo4W Installer, associated with a compass rose icon - this is an installer that supports more customization of the installation - advanced users may find this useful, for example to install development versions of the software or specific versions of the libraries QGIS depends on."

There are hundreds of plugins available, all freely available. To view and manage plugins, go to the Plugins menu at the top and navigate to Manage and install plugins\n\n\n\nGetting to Plugins\n\n\nThe The following dialogue box will open, allowing users to browse through or search available plugins, and then by using the tabs on the left, seeing what plugins are installed and so-forth.\n\n\n\nPlugins Window\n\n\nThis tutorial makes use of the following plugins:\n\nValue Tool\nQuickMapServices\n\nTo install the plugins, you can you can click the “Install Plugin” button that will appear when you select plugins from the list. Once plugins are installed, you can use the checkboxes that appear alongside those to enable or disable them; as plugins are installed, some may result in a new window being shown automatically, or a new “panel” available from the View menu; some may result in new icons appearing in the toolbar, a new menu being available at the top of the QGIS window."

    "section": "1.3 Basic Navigation in QGIS",
    "text": "1.3 Basic Navigation in QGIS\nWhen you open QGIS, you should see a window like the following.\n\n\n\nFirst Look at the main QGIS Window (after Value Tool and QuickMapServices plugins have been installed)\n\n\nThe labeled “sub-windows” you see, such as for the Browser, Layers, Value Tool and so forth are referred to as panels and the rows of icons across the top are toolbars. You can adjust what you are seeing in terms of panels and toolbars by going to the View menu a the top of the QGIS window, and selecting Panels or Toolbars appropriately (right-clicking on the toolbar also lets you see and turn on/off the panels and toolbars). Some icons may seem fairly intuitive, such as to zoom in () or zoom out (), but others may not be, so explore and don’t be afraid to try things out! It’s generally helpful to do this with smaller datasets loaded into QGIS to help iterate through the different tools and options more quickly.\nI strongly encourage users to explore QGIS to familiarize themselves a bit with the software - hover your mouse over icons to see what they say, click on menu items at the top and browse around, selecting through some different menus and such. QGIS is rich in functionality, with multiple ways to do many things, so this can help you figure out what the easiest ways are for you to approach workflows.\n\n1.3.1 Some initial setup\nUser may develop their own preferred ways of customizing things with any software. Here are two initial things I like to do for QGIS:\n\nDelineate “Favorites” in the Browser panel:\n\nThe Browser panel is a bit of a “one-stop-shop” to navigate around your local file system and load various types of layers.\nIf you navigate around the directories from within the Browser panel (expand what you see by clicking on the right-facing arrow to the left of a given name), you can right-click folders and select them as “Favorites.” If you keep files with data you use in some general locations, this can help save time to get to them - particularly if the data are several folders deep or something.\n\nMake the “Processing Toolbox” panel visible:\n\nIn QGIS, there are many tools accessible through the toolbars and menus at the top. The panel for the Processing Toolbox serves as a bit of a directory of all of the different tools that exist in QGIS.\nYou can make this panel active either by going through the View menu -&gt; Panels, or by clicking the Processing menu at the top and clicking on “Processing Toolbox.”\n\nThe screenshot below shows what this looks like (with the Processing Toolbox panel active). The Processing Toolbox has been scrolled down to show GDAL and GRASS - these are two software packages installed with QGIS and accessible through the Processing Toolbox. (GDAL is the core software in QGIS generally underlying import/export operations, and with additional functionality available for various processing steps). \n\n\n\nDepending on what you are doing at a given time, you can “x” out of individual panels and then re-instantiate them using View -&gt; Panels and you can resize them, pop them out, etc. by clicking on the top of each panel (at about the same area where the panel name is) and dragging it as desired."

    "text": "2.1 List of Tutorial Data\nThe data are all made available in a .zip file associated with the tutorial, and original sources are detailed below and each dataset is in a folder with the respective italicized & bolded name as follows, and the data files have their names in code-formatted text (sometimes they are within their own .zip files):\n\nVegetation Density Across NYC - nyc_propveg2017_200mbuffer_100ftgrid_nowater.tif:\n\na raster dataset where the value of each pixel represents the proportion of land cover within a 200 meter radius that was vegetated based on 6” resolution land cover data for NYC representing 2017. Each pixel represents a 100 foot by 100 foot area on the ground. The data are available on a data repository, Zenodo.\n\nCommunity District Boundaries - nycd.shp:\n\na vector dataset of (multi)polygons representing the 59 Community Districts in NYC, each of which has an associated Community Board NYC Department of City Planning Website. The version available here was the version already clipped to shorelines, and associated with NYC Department of City Planning release “23D.”\n\nNote, this dataset is a shapefile, which involves not only the .shp. file but a number of other, “sidecar” files. For the shapefile to work correctly, all of the other associated files must be kept with it, in the same folder.\n\n\nNYC Heat Vulnerability Index by Community District (2018) - NYC EH Data Portal - Heat vulnerability index (full table).csv:\n\nThe NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene produces the Heat Vulnerability Index (HVI) dataset to reflect the risk of community-level heat impacts, like deaths, due to extreme heat events; the index ranges 1-5, and higher numbers reflect higher vulnerability. The data used in this tutorial are based on a 2018 version of the dataset; a newer version, recently released in 2023, is available from the NYC Environment and Health Data Portal but with some limits in ability to join to other data at this point.\n\nTree Canopy and Street Tree Summary Data - canopy_streettree_supp.gpkg:\n\nThis file includes data on tree canopy change (2010-2017) and street trees aggregated to political and administrative units of Boroughs, Community Districts, City Council Districts (2010), and Neighborhood Tabulation Areas (2010).\n\nGreen Roof Data (Centroids) for NYC - GreenRoofData2016_20180917.csv:\n\nComma separated values file with the only spatial data for the green roofs being coordinates for the centroids in columns of xcoord and ycoord. The original dataset, along with more complete spatial data (green roof footprints) and full information about it is available on Zenodo.\n\nNYS Disadvantaged Communities 2023 - Final_DAC_Attributes.shp:\n\nShapefile with a dataset developed by the New York State Climate Justice Working Group, identifying areas with “disadvantaged communities to ensure that frontline and otherwise underserved communities benefit from the state’s historic transition to cleaner, greener sources of energy, reduced pollution and cleaner air, and economic opportunities.” The data, based on Census Tract polygons, along with documentation and an interactive map is available from a New York State Government website.\n\nNote, this dataset is a shapefile, which involves not only the .shp. file but a number of other, “sidecar” files. For the shapefile to work correctly, all of the other associated files must be kept with it, in the same folder.\n\n\n\n\n2.1.1 A note about data in .zip files in QGIS\nIn many cases, data are made available in a compressed, .zip format - this tends to particularly hold true when multiple files are shared together, either for functionality (e.g., with shapefiles and the associated sidecar files), or to ensure metadata stays with the associated data files. For many software packages, to even use the data in these files, they need to be “extracted” from the .zip format, and this functionality is generally included in a given operating system, third party tools (e.g., free and open source 7-zip). And for working with the tutorial, it is recommended that you do unzip the main folder of data made available.\nHowever, it is possible to work with data in read-only mode (i.e., edits to datasets downloaded cannot be made) - and this is often a good use case for spatial data processing, in which edits files involves writing out new data files. Thus, for working with the tutorial data, you can opt to leave any data in .zip files as they are. If you find that viewing or working with the data is slow, you may try unzipping the files to see if it makes a difference, but some benefits I see of working with the .zip files are:\n\nKeeping the “raw” or “source” data for a project uneditable in the .zip format helps ensure you can always go back to that original dataset if needed.\nBy not unzipping the data, you can reduce the storage space required for your project on your hard drive, since uncompressing may increase the size, and unless you delete the compressed files, there will be somewhat duplicate files on your drive. This can also help users keep data a bit better organized, simply because of the fewer folders and files.\n\nThis functionality in QGIS to work with uncompressed data (among other things), made possible by the Geospatial Data Abstraction Library (GDAL), in implementation of virtual file systems."

    "section": "3.1 Importing Data Already in GIS Formats",
    "text": "3.1 Importing Data Already in GIS Formats\nThere are a few different workflows that can be used to bring data into QGIS. Thankfully, for data already in GIS formats (e.g., shapefiles, geopackages, filegeodatabases, geotiffs), the steps can be as simple as drag and drop the file from your file explorer (e.g., Windows Explorer on Windows) into the QGIS Window. This generally involves having your file explorer open in the foreground over QGIS, and then clicking and holding on the desired file, and dragging it into the QGIS window, and releasing the click.\n\n\n\nExample of loading data into QGIS by dragging and dropping a file\n\n\nTry this with the Tree Canopy and Street Tree Summary Data, canopystreettree_supp.gpkg - just load the layer named canopystreettree_supp_communitydist for now\nSimilarly, users can navigate to location of desired files in the Browser panel and drag the files into the Layers panel or the main panels toward the middle of the QGIS window.\n*** Note - when you first load a vector dataset, the symbology will typically be the same for the entire layer and the color of the symbols will be randomly generated.***\nSome data formats, such as geopackage (.gpkg) and Esri file geodatabases (.gdb) can contain multiple datasets (spatial and non-spatial). When you go to load such data, where multiple datasets or layers are included through one of these drag and drop approaches, you will be prompted to select which data layers you want to include. The default is they are all included. Additionally, by expanding the Options at the bottom, you can choose to import the selected layers directly into a group, such that they are nested together in the Layers panel.\n\n\n\nExample of loading multi-layer file into QGIS\n\n\nAny tables of data in spatial formats without actual spatial data (e.g., non-spatial tables in a geopackage or file geodatabase) will simply appear as a table in QGIS. The same is the case for any data in non-spatial formats (e.g., text- or tab-delimited files)."

    "section": "3.2 Importing Data in Delimited Text (e.g., CSV) Files",
    "text": "3.2 Importing Data in Delimited Text (e.g., CSV) Files\nIn many cases data are found in non-GIS data formats, such as .csv files, which can be read into spreadsheet software such as Excel. Spatial data in these files may be in the form of columns representing x and y coordinates (for points) or in a single column with the information stored in a “WKT” or “Well-Known Text” format, which follows a specific convention for spatial information (this can include data for (multi) points, lines, and polygons data).\nThe process for importing these datasets is inherently not as simple as drag-and-drop, due to the fact that these files do not contain all of the information GIS software would need to display them correctly - some of it must be provided (or confirmed) by the user.\nAs an example, the data associated with this tutorial include a CSV file with centroids of green roofs in NYC. One workflow for bringing this dataset into QGIS is as follows:\n\nOpen the Data Source Manager ( - generally near the upper left in the toolbar; it is also available through CTRL+L on Windows and the Layers menu)\nSelect the Delimited Text option on the left, use the “…” to the right of the File name box box at the top to navigate to the file.\n\nIn this case, QGIS should automatically identify that it is a CSV file, and that the data are point coordinates, with the x- and y-fields being stored in the data in columns xcoord and ycoord, respectively. Users should always confirm QGIS is identifying such information correct.\nQGIS does not know what the CRS, or Coordinate Reference System is for these data, so the “Geometry CRS” entry says may either make an assumption, that it is in the same CRS as other data brought into QGIS already, or it will indicate “invalid projection” and this needs to be specified by the user. \n\nIn either case for this dataset, you will need to indicate to QGIS the correct CRS. The previous dataset we have brought in by this point was in the New York State Plane Long Island Zone, North American Datum of 1983, EPSG 2263, in US Feet. However, this dataset has the coordinates in Latitude/Longitude, in the WGS 84 Datum, EPSG 4326. Click on the icon to the right of this box about Coordinate Systems \n\nThen in the window that appears, use the text filter to search for ‘4326’ - which is a shorthand reference, an “EPSG” code to the appropriate Coordinate Reference System these coordinates are in - (More about Coordinate Reference Systems in the next chapter, Coordinate Reference Systems.) Expand the content in the next box, to reflect what you see in the screenshot below, and hit the Okay button. \nIn the Data Source Manager, you should now be able to click the “Add” button (which would have been grayed out until the CRS is defined).\n\nBefore the dataset appears in the Layers panel, and the points appear in the main window of QGIS, you may see a window pop up asking you to select the desired operations to convert between coordinate systems. You can simply go with the default option and click “OK.”\n\n\nThe data layer, layered on top of the other dataset we have brought in at this point should now appear something like the below (you’ll need to close out the Data Source Manager window). \n\n** At this point, load in each of the other data layers (except for other layers available with the Tree Canopy and Street Tree Summary data - for that, the Community District layer is the only one you’ll need). For the remaining datasets you can drag and drop from your file explorer or by navigating to them in the Browser panel; if the data are in .zip folders, you can use those. The NYC Heat Vulnerability Index data is a tabular data, and will not show anything in the main QGIS window, but we will use it later on.* \n\n3.2.1 Ordering and Grouping Layers\nAs the data layers were loaded, they generally should be listed in the Layers panel, in the order in which they were loaded (last layer at the bottom). This also reflects the ordering in the main map area, or the canvas - with the layers higher in the list being “on top” visually (i.e., the dataset of green roof points should be visible on top of everything else and you may not see some layers that are hidden behind or below others).\nTo change which layers are visible, you can use the check-boxes, to make them appear or disappear in the map canvas, and you can re-order in the Layers panel by clicking and holding on the desired layer, and moving it up or down with respect to the other layers.\nSometimes it is helpful to “group” layers - which has them nested under a title within the Layers panel, and then they, as a group, appear above or below the other layers based on the ordering within the panel. There will also be a check-box next to the group label, which you can use to turn on or off those layers together. To group/ungroup, select the desired layers by using CTRL + Click on each layer (or SHIFT + Click on the first and last layer if all consecutively ordered), right click, and select “Group Selected.”\n\n\n\nGrouping layers by selecting the desired layers in the Layers panel and right-clicking\n\n\nYou can then move layers into and out of the group by clicking/dragging them around. You can also create a new group using the respective icon at the top of the Layers panel  and then drag layers in and out as desired.\n\n\n\nExample of grouped layers in the Layers panel\n\n\nUpon creating a group, you can rename it by right clicking on it and selecting “Rename Group.” Similarly, you can rename layers for use in the QGIS project by right clicking on them and selecting “Rename Layer.”\n\n\n3.2.2 Saving a Project\nAt this point, we’ve done a few different steps, and as with so much work, would not want to have to redo things we’ve already done if anything happens - the computer or software crashes. To do this the first time, you can click the  on the toolbar, navigate to the desired folder where you want to save the project, set a name, and click “Save.”\nThe default format is a .qgz file, which is suitable for most use cases. If you are working on a shared drive with others, you may opt to use the .qgs format, which at least in my experience, works better if multiple people may be opening the project from different user accounts (e.g., on a server).\nAs you work, you can click the  or use CTRL + S on the keyboard to save as you go.\nYou can also save an existing project into a new file by using the Project menu and selecting “Save As” or using CTRL + SHIFT + S on the keyboard."

With the Value Tool panel active (click the ), as you move your mouse across the canvas, it will show the values for the pixels from a raster dataset (you may need to resize the columns to see the values). The image below shows an example with the raster data from this tutorial, with the “Decimals” box checked to only show two decimal places of information in the Value column.\n\n\n\nExample of the Value Tool\n\n\nAs you mouse over the raster you will see the values change."

    "section": "3.4 Basic Styling",
    "text": "3.4 Basic Styling\nAs you look at data with different kinds of information, you likely want to style it to your liking - either for making maps, or just getting some specific insights. To get to the style settings, you can either open the Layer Styling panel and select the desired layer in the Layers panel, or you can right click/double clock on any layer in the Layers panel, select “Properties” get to the Properties window and click on the relevant tabs on the left to get to styling menus for things like Symbology Labels. Users may find one or the other approach works better for them. Due to the different nature of vector and raster datasets, the styling menus are a bit different across these two\n\n3.4.1 Vector Styling\nFor vector data, the symbology options generally look along the lines of the below (for the Green Roof Centroids dataset).\n\n\n\nSymbology menu for a point layer (the Green Roof Centroids dataset in the Layer Properties Window\n\n\nUsers can do a variety of things here such as:\n\nClick in the colored box or use the dropdown icon to the right of it to select a different color, adjust some different parameters (e.g., size and opacity);\nSelect a different initial symbol type from the set towards the bottom of the window;\nUse the dropdown next to the word “Favorites” to access some different sets of symbol options or select the “All Symbols” option;\nIn the upper area, click on “Simple Marker” and adjust the various options that become visible;\nClick the  towards the top to add multiple symbology types (e.g., for point data a second symbol could be added to be a bigger circle around the point);\nUse the dropdown menu from the top for options to color different features in a relatively automated way.\n\nThere is A LOT to explore in terms of symbology. The Categorized or Graduated symbology options from the dropdown menu at the top is one of the most useful features in my work. As an example, with the Green Roof Centroids dataset, if I choose the “Graduated” symbology option, I can than select for the “Value” field any numeric variable; for this tutorial I’ll chose gr_area representing the area of the green roof surface in square feet. Leaving Symbol type as-is, I select a color ramp of Greens (light to dark greens), then leave the “Mode” for the styling as “Equal Count” (which results in about the same number of data points with each color along the gradient) and hit “Classify.”\n\n\n\nExample of Layer Properties - Symbology menu for the Green Roof Centroids Dataset, using a graduated symbology\n\n\nAfter adjusting the settings, clicking “OK” will apply the styling choices and close the window; clicking “Apply” will apply the styling choices but leave the window open for further adjustments.\n\n\n\nThe Green Roof Centroids dataset with a graduated style applied\n\n\nOne thing that is sometimes useful is having the border of symbols be the same color as the symbols themselves, and while one could go symbol by symbol along a set of specific styles, some built-in functionality makes this pretty easy in QGIS:\n\nIn the main Layer Properties - Symbology menu, select the Simple Marker (for a Single Symbol styles) or click on the default symbol for a Graduated, Categorized, or similar style and then to the Simple Marker\nClick on the dropdown menu to the right of the “Stroke Color” then click “Edit” \nIn in the box on the left type @symbol_color \nclick “OK” to apply and close the settings until you are back to the styles and then the map canvas, and you will see that what was a black ring around the points is now a ring the same color as the points themselves. \n\nWhile the above examples are for styling points, similar approaches can be applied to lines and polygons as well.\n*** Tips:\n\nNeed to apply the same style to multiple similar layers with the same field name and similar value ranges? You can right click on a layer, navigate to Styles -&gt; Copy Style -&gt; All Style Categories and then right click on another layer, navigate to Styles -&gt; Paste Style -&gt; All Style Categories to save some work.\n\n\n\n\n3.4.2 Raster Styling\nDue to the nature of raster data compared to vector data, adjusting the symbology is a bit different. In general, raster layers will default to having a grayscale symbology applied, with darker shades for the lower values and lighter for higher values, as you may have noticed for the Vegetation Density dataset. In general, we may want to adjust adjust the styling in various ways - the main thing to adjust is the Render Type - you’ll the following options:\n\nMultiband color - Generally for an image (a type of raster dataset), where, for example, there are different layers that represent red, green, and blue parts of the visible spectrum, and these layers can be merged visually to be what people might generally see (e.g., from an aerial image or satellite image).\nPaletted/Unique Values - Typically for a categorical dataset, such as land cover data, where each pixel value represents a different type.\nSingleband gray - The default for most raster datasets loaded in, where there is a single layer with values that can be represented along a continuous gradient (these can be integer or decimal, spanning positive and negative numbers).\nSingleband pseudocolor - An option to apply various color gradients (including user-defined ones) to a singleband dataset such as described in the previous option.\nHillshade - Generally used to style elevation data in an aesthetically pleasing way that helps visualize the topography of the landscape.\nContours - Can be used to draw “contour lines” as are often applied on topographic maps, to delineate specific breaks along the landscape. While this is often used with elevation data, it can be used with other continuous variables, such as on air quality, soil moisture, etc.\n\nIn this example with the Vegetation Density raster, we will chose the Singleband pseudocolor option. If you expand the “Min / Max Value Settings” portion of the menu, you can see a number of options - the defaults are generally okay, but you can try adjusting these as desired. If working with a dataset that has a known range and the values for the color ramp do not meet the whole range, you may want to either set “User defined” values or change the “Accuracy” option from “Estimate (faster)” to “Actual (slower).” As with before, I’m adjusting the color ramp to be Greens, and then hitting “OK.”\n\n\n\nExample of Layer Properties - Symbology menu for the Vegetation Density raster dataset\n\n\nThe result should look along the lines of the following:\n\n\n\nVegetation Density dataset with a green color gradient applied\n\n\nUsers can save and load style for layers, both for vector and raster datasets. Included in the folder with the Vegetation Density data is a .qml file that contains styling information used for the main map in the blog post about that dataset from the NYC Environmental Justice Alliance and the The Nature Conservancy’s NY Cities Program as part of the Just Nature NYC partnership. From the Layer Properties - Symbology menu, users can go to the “Style” button near the bottom, select “Load Style” and set the File to use as vegmapping_style_qgis_tutorial.qml and click “Load Style.”\n\nFrom there, simply clicking “Apply” or “OK” should yield a map that looks like the below, where the transition from yellow to green happens at the 0.32 mark, which is the proportion of land area within a 200 meter radius area that needs to be covered by vegetation to start reducing air temperatures, based on research led by the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene.\n\n\n\nVegetation Density dataset with a yellow-greens gradient applied based on a custom style loaded form a .qml file\n\n\n\n\n3.4.3 Basemaps\nIn QGIS there are a few different ways to bring in basemaps. Users familiar with different web services (e.g., WMS/WMTS, ArcGIS REST services, etc.) can specify those through the Data Source Manager or the Browser panel, but more simply, for many use cases, users can use the QuickMapServices plugin. If it is not already up, you can click the  on the toolbar. From there, in the SearchQMS panel, users can search for various basemaps, such as from Google. Note, these are not necessarily licensed openly for broad reuse, but for visualizing datasets together, this can still be useful! Additionally, if you search for “nyc.gov” you can find basemaps, labels, and imagery specific to NYC from the City of New York, and acceptable for use in various ways under a Creative Commons license - see the associated website. To load a given basemap into QGIS, users can double-click an entry, or click the “Add” button; the layers get added to the bottom of the list of layers in the Layers panel.\n\n\n\nExample of the Green Roof Centroid data mapped over a basemap"

    "text": "4.1 Checking and Setting Project and Layer CRS\nQGIS automatically reads Coordinate Reference System information, if available, from data layers. For shapefiles, it generally relies on the .prj sidecar file; for most other vector formats and raster data, it is generally embedded in the file. If you load data without built-in projection information (e.g., a Delimited Text File), it generally assumes a geographic coordinate system - either Latitude/Longitude in the WGS 84 datum (EPSG 4326) or the Project CRS, generally defined based on the first dataset loaded for a project unless otherwise specified by the user.\nTo see what the Project CRS is, you can check the bottom-right corner of the main QGIS window and it will indicate next the  - you can click . Alternatively, go to the Project menu at the top of the QGIS window, select Project Properties and then select the CRS tab on the side. In the tutorial project I set up for myself in working through this tutorial, the Project CRS is NAD83 / New York Long Island (ftUS), with a shorthand code, the EPSG code, being 2263 (EPSG 2263). For the data in this tutorial, this is a good, locally-appropriate CRS.\n\n\n\nExample of looking at the Coordinate Reference System for a project, showing in this case, the Project CRS is NAD83 / New York Long Island (ftUS), EPSG 2263. Clicking on the area circled in Purple in the main QGIS window is a shortcut to get to the Project Properties - CRS window, shown here in the foreground.\n\n\nTo check what CRS QGIS is using for a layer, the quickest way is to right-click on a layer, and hover over “Layer CRS” - the top item in what appears is the CRS that QGIS is using. From here, users can change the Project CRS to that of the layer, or change it. Note, “setting” the layer CRS is simply telling QGIS how to interpret the coordinates associated with the spatial data. If the data are not actually in the CRS being assigned, things will not appear to be in the right places.\n\n\n\nChecking the layer CRS for the Green Roof Centroid data\n\n\n\n4.1.1 On the Fly Projection\nQGIS and most other GIS software has what is called On the Fly Projection meaning that data do not need to be in the same CRS to be viewed together in the correct place. Basically, the necessary mathematical transformations are conducted by the software as needed to support visualizing all of the data together. To see what things might look like if this was not the case, you can go to the Project CRS information as shown above, and check the box at the top for “No CRS (or unknown/non-earth projection)” and then use the  in the toolbar to zoom to the full extent all of the layers at once. What you see will likely look very zoomed out, and you will see some data, quite small, and far apart from one-another, and maybe not see others because they are so small when plotted on common units, rather than re-projected on the fly so everything lines up.\nTo get back to how things were, go back to the Project CRS, uncheck the box you just checked, select the appropriate CRS (EPSG 2263 in this case), and click “OK.”"

    "text": "4.2 Transforming to a Different CRS - Vector Data\nPer the note at the beginning of this section, data layers should generally be in the same CRS for spatial processing operations (any way in which you are using the data together, spatially, beyond visualization). While EPSG 2263 is a generally suitable CRS for work in NYC, not all of the layers shared with this tutorial are in this CRS; in particular, the following are in different CRSs - Green Roof Centroids data (in Latitude/Longitude coordinates according to the WGS84 datum) and the Disadvantaged Communities Data (in UTM zone), thus they should be transformed to align with the CRS of the other layers.\nIn QGIS transform vector to a different CRS, or “reprojecting” the data is generally done through an export operation, where the spatial data are transformed to in the process of the export. To start, right-click on a layer, navigate to “Export” and select “Save Features As.”\n\n\n\nNavigating to vector layer export menu\n\n\nIn the menu that pops up, you can chose from different formats; in this case I will select GeoPackage (.gpkg extension), an open standard format that can have multiple layers within a single file. For my tutorial project, I’ll create a single where I will save my outputs. You can set the destination file location and name for the GeoPackage file, and specify the layer name, which will default to the same name as the original. For work like this, I tend to adjust the layer name to reflect the important change, and I add “_epsg2263” to the end of the default. Then, most importantly, for CRS, you should be able to select EPSG:2263 from the dropdown menu for CRS, but if you don’t, you can search for it and select it via the  icon to the right of that. From there, generally the defaults for the export can be left as-is, leave the box checked at the bottom to “Add saved file to map” and click “OK.”\n\n\n\nSample dialogue box for exporting the Green Roof Centroid data while transforming the data to the desired CRS\n\n\nBefore proceeding in this tutorial, please reproject the Disadvantaged Communities dataset\nSome notes for after export:\n\nWhen the layer is loaded upon export, the default name for GeoPackage layers can be rather long, thus you may wish to rename to a shorter but intuitive name;\nAs data are exported and re-imported, the layer styling is lost. Thus, you may wish to right click on the original layer, navigate to copy the layer styles, and then paste them to the new, reprojected version;\nWith the new version of the layer loaded, you may want to remove the old version - you can do this by clicking on it and then using the  icon at the top of the Layers panel, or by right-clicking on the layer and selecting “Remove Layer.”"

    "text": "5.1 Tabular Joins\nIn many cases data are made available for common administrative or political geographic units. For example, in the United States, data are often made available by units such as, from larger units to (generally) smaller, State, County, City, Census Tracts. In New York City, a number of datasets are released at the scale of Community Districts; each Community District has a Board that weights in on a variety of types of issues, and serves as a space for broader public engagement from the associated geographic area.\nCommunity District boundaries for New York City, made available by the Department of City Planning, are one of the datasets shared with this tutorial. Both the Heat Vulnerability Index data, which is a non-spatial data table, and the Tree Canopy and Street Tree Summary data with the tutorial data are available for Community Districts. Thus, we should be able to associate data from these different datasets together, or “join” them based on the unique identifier for each Community District. In this case, because the Community District Boundaries as made available from the NYC Department of City Planning are the simplest, in that they primarily have the spatial polygon data and the Community District identifiers, we will join these other datasets to it. In the working project for this demo, the layer name for the Community District Boundaries is “nycd_23d/nycd.shp” (the default name from dragging and dropping the .zip folder with the data into QGIS). Before going through the below steps, I have looked at the attribute tables to find that:\n\nIn the Heat Vulnerability Index data table, the Community District identifier is coded in the column (field) borocd.\nIn the Tree Canopy and Street Tree Summary data for Community Districts, the Community District identifier is in the field borocd.\nIn the Community District Boundaries dataset, the Community District identifier is in the field BoroCD.\n\nTo create the tabular join to associate the Heat Vulnerability Index with the Community District boundaries:\n\nGo to the Layer Properties window for the Community District Boundaries.\nClick on the “Joins” tab on the left side of the window.\nClick the  at the bottom.\nAs the “Join layer” specify the Heat Vulnerability Index dataset.\nFor the “Join field,” or column of data from the dataset being joined to the Community District Boundaries, specify the field that has the Community District identifiers (borocd)\nSpecify the “Target field,” or the field that the Heat Vulnerability Index dataset is being joined to, as BoroCD\nIn this case, we may do not really need any fields other than the index itself, or the “Score” so we can check the box next to “Joined fields” and then check the box next to the desired field.\nClick “OK” in the Joins window and then in the Layer Properties to get back to the main QGIS window.\nOpen the attribute table for the Community District Boundaries and see if it worked!\n\n\n\n\nSetting up the join between the Heat Vulnerability Index data and the Community District Boundaries\n\n\nAnd when we look at the attribute table for the Community District Boundaries, we see a column with the Heat Vulnerability Index rank. (Some rows have no entry, which is expected as those rows are for unpopulated areas, such as large parks and airports.)\n\n\n\nAttribute table of the Community District Boundaries layer after joining the Heat Vulnerability Data based on the Community District identifier\n\n\n\n5.1.1 Saving Tabular Join Results\nTabular joins accomplished through the above steps are only stored “in memory” until exported While they will be maintained when the project is saved, it is necessary to export the Community District Boundaries dataset as a new dataset to have the joined data more permanently available with that dataset.\nThere are multiple ways to do tabular joins in QGIS; there is another workflow that can result in directly exporting the results to a new layer. You can find that as the Join Attributes by Field Value tool in the Processing Toolbox.\n\n\n5.1.2 Try it yourself!\nAs another tabular join, try to join the Tree Canopy and Street Tree summaries by Community District to the Community District Boundaries (with the Heat Vulnerability Index already joined). The dataset is large - consider only keeping one or two fields of interest from the Tree Canopy and Street Tree summary data."

    "text": "5.2 Spatial Joins\nOne of the most valuable aspects of GIS software is the ability to integrate different spatial datasets. In this case, for example, we can associate something like the Community District identifier with each green roof, or we can count the number of green roofs per Community District. Lets do both!\n\n5.2.1 Associating Broader data with Local Data\nWith the data available with this tutorial, we can do a spatial join to add information on Community District (e.g., which Community District) to the individual green roof points. We will use the Join Attributes by Location tool from the Processing Toolbox.\n\nSet the “Join to features in” to the green roof dataset\nFor the “Features they (geometric predicate)” - this is basically the place to specify what kind of relationship we are looking for between the green roof points and the Community District boundaries. In this case, we want information based on where the green roof points are within the Community District boundaries.\nThe only field of interest in this case to add onto the Green Roof Data is the Community District identifier (BoroCD).\nSet the “Join Type” to “Create separate feature for each matching feature (one-to-many)”\n\nBasically this is to specify that should there be instances where the boundary dataset had overlapping polygons, if multiple polygons overlapped with a green roof point, the output would have multiple entries for that green roof point, each with the respective Community District (in this case) identifier. This is not an issue in this case, but could be with different datasets.\n\nIn the screenshot below I have left it so the result is only written out as a “Temporary layer” but you could opt to use the icon to the left of that box to specify a destination file.\nClick “Run”!\n\n\n\n\nSetting up a spatial join to get information about Community Districts associated with the Green Roof Centroids\n\n\nAfter this runs, you will see a new result in the Layers panel, “Joined layer,” with an associated dataset shown on the map canvas. The attribute table should include both the fields from the original Green Roof Centroid data, as well as the Community District identifier.\n\n\n5.2.2 Summarizing Local data to Larger Areas\nIn many cases we may want to count the number of something within geographic units. In this case, we can count how many green roofs are in each Community DIstrict. To do this, we use the Join Attribute by Location (Summary) tool from the Processing Toolbox.\n\nSpecify the “Join to features in” dataset as the Community District boundaries.\nCheck the box for “contain” for “Where the features.”\nSet the “By comparing to” dataset as the Green Roof Centroid data (make sure to use the version reprojected to EPSG 2263).\nFor “Fields to summarise” if you leave this out, you will end up with the desired summary statistics for all of these fields. Thus, I have selected only the unique identifier field, fid.\nFor “Summaries to calculate” - if you leave blank, it will calculate all possible summaries. I selected “Count” as the metric of interest.\nAgain, you can opt to write the output to a permanent file, or leave the default to create a temporary layer.\n\n\n\n\nSetting up spatial join to count the number of Green Roofs, based on their centroids, within each Community District\n\n\nAs with the previous operation, you should see a result of a “Joined layer” and see a new field reflecting the count of green roofs, as well as the fields originally in the Community District Boundaries dataset."

With the tutorial data, we calculate metrics from the Vegetation Density data by Community District - for example, to understand how the different Community Districts may have higher average values for vegetation density than others. To do this, we’ll use the Zonal Statistics tool from the Processing Toolbox, which calculates statistics of a raster layer for each feature of an overlapping polygon layer.\n\nSpecify the Input layer as the COmmunity District Boundaries.\nSpecify the Raster Layer as the Vegetation Density raster.\nWe can specify a prefix for the new columns that will be created to help ease remembering what the new columns will have been created from (e.g., “PropVeg_”).\nWe can specify a variety of statistics to calculate; in this case, I’ve specified that the the Mean and Median vegetation density values should be calculated for each Community District.\nClick “Run”!\n\n\n\n\nSetting up a Zonal Statistics operation to calculate summary statistics from the Vegetation Density data layer for each Community Districts\n\n\nYou should see a new layer titled “Zonal Statistics” with fields reflecting the Mean and Median values for the Vegetation Density layer."

    "section": "6.1 QGIS Layouts",
    "text": "6.1 QGIS Layouts\nCartography in QGIS is mainly done through the Layouts window and respective set of tools. You can start creating a new print layout by clicking  towards the upper-left of toolbar in QGIS - if you do so, you will be prompted to name the layout. You can also click the Layout Manager icon , which will let you see what other layouts, if any, you’ve already created and create new ones, among other things.\nAfter clicking  and entering a name for a new layout, a new window will open - you may need to maximize it depending on your own computer. Once there, you can right-click on the blank white area, and select “Page Properties” to adjust things like the background color to be working with, and the paper size.\n\n\n\nExample of a blank layout, with Page Properties pane open\n\n\nThe default size is A4, or an 8.5x11 piece of paper; I often find myself using a custom sized, square sheet for NYC maps, so I change the “Size” to “Custom”, change the units from millimeters to inches, and specify the width and height as 7 inches.\nThis is basically the blank area with which we can fill with a map (or maps!) - to enable bringing a map from the main QGIS window into a Print Layout start by clicking , then click and drag across the page area. Whatever you had in the main QGIS window should now appear. Also, the “Item properties” should be tied to the map that you just drew, with parameters associated with that (e.g., showing the map scale, any desired rotation, among many other things). At the top of the item properties for the Map, you will see icons, which will, for example, refresh what is shown on the page to reflect what is in the main map canvas, if you have changed things there. So, go back to your map canvas and adjust things to start working towards what you might like to show in a map!\nOnce you have a set of layers and styles you generally like for your map, in the Item Properties for the Map, check the “Lock Layers” box, which will not affect the main map canvas, but will keep what is shown in the Print Layout as they are. Otherwise, any changes you make in the main map canvas would show up here.\n\n\n\nThe start of a map with Community District Boundaries and the Vegetation Density layer\n\n\nNow, you can start adding things that might help make the map make sense - browse around and find things that you can add (e.g.,  for a legend,  for a North arrow).\nWith all of these things you can add, just as you did to add the map to the layout, you will click the respective icon, then click and drag to lay out a box of where the item should be placed. For each item, there will be a separate different options for the “Item Properties.”\nLegends can be tricky, as by default all layers are included. However, you can check the box in the Item Properties for the legend, in the area with “Legend Items,” to only show the items within the map being shown. You’ll see the legend entries on the map decrease to only the layers being shown. Additionally, there are lots of options for fonts, spacing, and other aspects, worth browsing around for. Further, for each legend entry, you can, in the Item Properties, click the text to edit what the text will be in the legend. In my experience it can be helpful, for individual maps, to turn off “Auto Update” as you may edit things like labels for the legend items, and do not want those edits to be lost as QGIS updates based on what is being done through the main window (e.g., based on editing layer names or similar).\nBy default, with a raster, the legend will say something like “Band 1 (Gray),” as with the Vegetation Density data. In the Legend Items list, you can expand the legend entries for that layer, select that row of information that says “Band 1 (Gray”) and then click  below to remove it. (The box for Auto-Update must be unchecked to do this.)\nAnd note, there are different ways to improve the appearance of legends, such as for rasters, in the symbology settings for the layers - what is shown below is just the basic example to start with.\n\n\n\nUsing the Item Properties tab to adjust the legend entries\n\n\nWhile you can add a new text box in the layout for a map title, I’ve decided to use the Legend Title space as a place for the map title. For the full title I wanted to include, “Vegetation Density Across NYC Community Districts” would overlap portions of the data being shown, I used the ability to specify a character on which to wrap the text - I used a backslash but you could chose any character that is not part of the title. (In the text of the title, below, you can see I inserted a backslash between “NYC” and “Community” and specified that as the “wrap text on” character, and the backslash is not visible in the title on the page).\n\n\n\nUsing the “Wrap text on” functionality for legend title adjustments\n\n\nI also scrolled down in the Item Properties for the legend, and unchecked the “Background” so that if the legend box overlapped with parts of the map itself, it was not visible.\nAs an example, below is the map I produced.\n\n\n\nSample map from QGIS\n\n\nYou can then export the map to various formats including as images (), PDFs (), and SVG files ()"
