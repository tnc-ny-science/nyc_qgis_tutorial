    "text": "Before you get started\nWelcome! New to GIS? Or new to using the powerful free and open source GIS software, QGIS? The intent of this material is to provide a provide a working knowledge the new GIS/QGIS user, so they may navigate the software for their own work, and further explore its capabilities. This tutorial is by no-means comprehensive. I suggest users browse and search the QGIS documentation when they are stuck, and make use of relevant support channels, and search around online for other tutorial materials, trainings, etc. Furthermore, examples of workflows given here are intended to be fairly heuristic, and serve as a starting point. For a given workflow or analysis, users should explore and experiment with different options, and research concepts further as needed.\nThis website is set up as a tutorial for getting familiar with GIS using QGIS. It has evolved from materials originally developed in academic contexts (workshops, course materials) at Texas A&M University, The University of Tulsa, and the Pratt Institute, and is most recently converted from a PDF/Word Doc only to this interactive book format that uses on NYC-related environmental data amidst my work with The Nature Conservancy. I’m fortunate that my time spent developing and updating these materials has been covered by the institutions I have been based at along the way.\nFor past versions of this tutorial with the associated data for those versions, go here."

To view and manage plugins, go to the Plugins menu at the top and navigate to Manage and install plugins\n\n\n\nGetting to Plugins\n\n\nThe The following dialogue box will open, allowing users to browse through or search available plugins, and then by using the tabs on the left, seeing what plugins are installed and so-forth.\n\n\n\nPlugins Window\n\n\nThis tutorial makes use of the following plugins:\n\nValue Tool\nQuickMapServices\n\nTo install the plugins, you can you can click the “Install Plugin” button that will appear when you select plugins from the list. Once plugins are instlalled, you can use the checkboxes that appear alongside those to enable or disable them; as plugins are installed, some may result in a new window being shown automatically, or a new “panel” available from the View menu; some may result in new icons appearing in the toolbar, a new menu being available at the top of the QGIS window."

It’s generally helpful to do this with smaller datasets loaded into QGIS to help iterate through the different tools and options more quickly.\nI strongly encourage users to explore QGIS to familiarize themselves a bit with the software - hover your mouse over icons to see what they say, click on menu items at the top and browse around, selecting through some different menus and such. QGIS is rich in functionality, with multiple ways to do many things, so this can help you figure out what the easiest ways are for you to approach workflows.\n\n1.3.1 Some initial setup\nUser may develop their own preferred ways of customizing things with any software.

    "section": "3.1 Importing Data Already in GIS Formats",
    "text": "3.1 Importing Data Already in GIS Formats\nThere are a few different workflows that can be used to bring data into QGIS. Thankfully, for data already in GIS formats (e.g., shapefiles, geopackages, filegeodatabases, geotiffs), the steps can be as simple as drag and drop the file from your file explorer (e.g., Windows Explorer on Windows) into the QGIS Window. This generally involves having your file explorer open in the foreground over QGIS, and then clicking and holding on the desired file, and dragging it into the QGIS window, and releasing the click.\n\n\n\nExample of loading data into QGIS by dragging and dropping a file\n\n\nTry this with the Tree Canopy and Street Tree Summary Data, canopystreettree_supp.gpkg - just load the layer named canopystreettree_supp_communitydist for now\nSimilarly, users can navigate to location of desired files in the Browser panel and drag the files into the Layers panel or the main panels toward the middle of the QGIS window.\n*** Note - when you first load a vector dataset, the symbology will typically be the same for the entire layer and the color of the symbols will be randomly generated.***\nSome data formats, such as geopackage (.gpkg) and Esri file geodatabases (.gdb) can contain multiple datasets (spatial and non-spatial). When you go to load such data, where multiple datasets or layers are included through one of these drag and drop approaches, you will be prompted to select which data layers you want to include. The default is they are all included. Additionally, by expanding the Options at the bottom, you can choose to import the selected layers directly into a group, such that they are nested together in the Layers panel.\n\n\n\nExample of loading multi-layer file into QGIS\n\n\nAny tables of data in spatial formats without actual spatial data (e.g., non-spatial tables in a geopackage or file geodatabase) will simply appear as a table in QGIS. The same is the case for any data in non-spatial formats (e.g., text- or tab-delimited files)."

    "section": "3.2 Importing Spatial Data in Delimited Text (e.g., CSV) Files",
    "text": "3.2 Importing Spatial Data in Delimited Text (e.g., CSV) Files\nIn many cases data are found in non-GIS data formats, such as .csv files, which can be read into spreadsheet software such as Excel. Spatial data in these files may be in the form of columns representing x and y coordinates (for points) or in a single column with the information stored in a “WKT” or “Well-Known Text” format, which follows a specific convention for spatial information (this can include data for (multi) points, lines, and polygons data).\nThe process for importing these datasets is inherently not as simple as drag-and-drop, due to the fact that these files do not contain all of the information GIS software would need to display them correctly - some of it must be provided (or confirmed) by the user.\nAs an example, the data associated with this tutorial include a CSV file with centroids of green roofs in NYC. One workflow for bringing this dataset into QGIS is as follows:\n\nOpen the Data Source Manager ( - generally near the upper left in the toolbar; it is also available through CTRL+L on Windows and the Layers menu)\nSelect the Delimited Text option on the left, use the “…” to the right of the File name box box at the top to navigate to the file.\n\nIn this case, QGIS should automatically identify that it is a CSV file, and that the data are point coordinates, with the x- and y-fields being stored in the data in columns xcoord and ycoord, respectively. Users should always confirm QGIS is identifying such information correct.\nQGIS does not know what the CRS, or Coordinate Reference System is for these data, so the “Geometry CRS” entry says “invalid projection” and this needs to be specified by the user. \nClick on the icon to the right of this box \nThen in the window that appears, use the text filter to search for ‘2263’ - which is a shorthand reference, an “EPSG” code to the appropriate Coordinate Reference System these coordinates are in - the New York State Plane Long Island Zone, according to the North American Datum of 1983, in US Feet. (More about Coordinate Reference Systems in the next chapter.) Expand the content in the next box, to reflect what you see in the screenshot below, and hit the Okay button. \nIn the Data Source Manager, you should now be able to click the “Add” button (which would have been grayed out until the CRS is defined).\n\nBefore the dataset appears in the Layers panel, and the points appear in the main window of QGIS, you may see a window pop up like the following, asking you to select the desired operations to convert between coordinate systems. You can simply go with the default option and click “Okay.” \n\n\nThe data layer should now appear something like the below (you’ll need to close out the Data Source Manager window)."

    "text": "3.4 Basic Styling\nAs you look at data with different kinds of information, you likely want to style it to your liking - either for making maps, or just getting some specific insights. To get to the style settings, you can either open the Layer Styling panel and select the desired layer in the Layers panel, or you can right click/double clock on any layer in the Layers panel, select “Properties” get to the Properties window and click on the relevant tabs on the left to get to styling menus for things like Symbology Labels. Users may find one or the other approach works better for them. Due to the different nature of vector and raster datasets, the styling menus are a bit different across these two\n\n3.4.1 Vector Styling\nFor vector data, the symbology options generally look along the lines of the below (for the Green Roof Centroids dataset).\n\n\n\nSymbology menu for a point layer (the Green Roof Centroids dataset in the Layer Properties Window\n\n\nUsers can do a variety of things here such as:\n\nClick in the colored box or use the dropdown icon to the right of it to select a different color, adjust some different parameters (e.g., size and opacity);\nSelect a different initial symbol type from the set towards the bottom of the window;\nUse the dropdown next to the word “Favorites” to access some different sets of symbol options or select the “All Symbols” option;\nIn the upper area, click on “Simple Marker” and adjust the various options that become visible;\nClick the  towards the top to add multiple symbology types (e.g., for point data a second symbol could be added to be a bigger circle around the point);\nUse the dropdown menu from the top for options to color different features in a relatively automated way.\n\nThere is A LOT to explore in terms of symbology. The Categorized or Graduated symbology options from the dropdown menu at the top is one of the most useful features in my work. As an example, with the Green Roof Centroids dataset, if I choose the “Graduated” symbology option, I can than select for the “Value” field any numeric variable; for this tutorial I’ll chose gr_area representing the area of the green roof surface in square feet. Leaving Symbol type as-is, I select a color ramp of Greens (light to dark greens), then leave the “Mode” for the styling as “Equal Count” (which results in about the same number of data points with each color along the gradient) and hit “Classify.”\n\n\n\nExample of Layer Properties - Symbology menu for the Green Roof Centroids Dataset, using a graduated symbology\n\n\nAfter adjusting the settings, clicking “OK” will apply the styling choices and close the window; clicking “Apply” will apply the styling choices but leave the window open for further adjustments.\n\n\n\nThe Green Roof Centroids dataset with a graduated style applied\n\n\nOne thing that is sometimes useful is having the border of symbols be the same color as the symbols themselves, and while one could go symbol by symbol along a set of specific styles, some built-in functionality makes this pretty easy in QGIS:\n\nIn the main Layer Properties - Symbology menu, select the Simple Marker (for a Single Symbol styles) or click on the default symbol for a Graduated, Categorized, or similar style and then to the Simple Marker\nClick on the dropdown menu to the right of the “Stroke Color” then click “Edit” \nIn in the box on the left type @symbol_color \nclick “OK” to apply and close the settings until you are back to the styles and then the map canvas, and you will see that what was a black ring around the points is now a ring the same color as the points themselves. \n\nWhile the above examples are for styling points, similar approaches can be applied to lines and polygons as well.\n*** Tips:\n\nNeed to apply the same style to multiple similar layers with the same field name and similar value ranges? You can right click on a layer, navigate to Styles -&gt; Copy Style -&gt; All Style Categories and then right click on another layer, navigate to Styles -&gt; Paste Style -&gt; All Style Categories to save some work.\n\n\n\n\n3.4.2 Raster Styling\nDue to the nature of raster data compared to vector data, adjusting the symbology is a bit different. In general, raster layers will default to having a grayscale symbology applied, with darker shades for the lower values and lighter for higher values, as you may have noticed for the Vegetation Density dataset. In general, we may want to adjust adjust the styling in various ways - the main thing to adjust is the Render Type - you’ll the following options:\n\nMultiband color - Generally for an image (a type of raster dataset), where, for example, there are different layers that represent red, green, and blue parts of the visible spectrum, and these layers can be merged visually to be what people might generally see (e.g., from an aerial image or satellite image).\nPaletted/Unique Values - Typically for a categorical dataset, such as land cover data, where each pixel value represents a different type.\nSingleband gray - The default for most raster datasets loaded in, where there is a single layer with values that can be represented along a continuous gradient (these can be integer or decimal, spanning positive and negative numbers).\nSingleband pseudocolor - An option to apply various color gradients (including user-defined ones) to a singleband dataset such as described in the previous option.\nHillshade - Generally used to style elevation data in an aesthetically pleasing way that helps visualize the topography of the landscape.\nContours - Can be used to draw “contour lines” as are often applied on topographic maps, to delineate specific breaks along the landscape. While this is often used with elevation data, it can be used with other continuous variables, such as on air quality, soil moisture, etc.\n\nIn this example with the Vegetation Density raster, we will chose the Singleband pseudocolor option. If you expand the “Min / Max Value Settings” portion of the menu, you can see a number of options - the defaults are generally okay, but you can try adjusting these as desired. If working with a dataset that has a known range and the values for the color ramp do not meet the whole range, you may want to either set “User defined” values or change the “Accuracy” option from “Estimate (faster)” to “Actual (slower).” As with before, I’m adjusting the color ramp to be Greens, and then hitting “OK.”\n\n\n\nExample of Layer Properties - Symbology menu for the Vegetation Density raster dataset\n\n\nThe result should look along the lines of the following:\n\n\n\nVegetation Density dataset with a green color gradient applied\n\n\nUsers can save and load style for layers, both for vector and raster datasets. Included in the folder with the Vegetation Density data is a .qml file that contains styling information used for the main map in the blog post about that dataset from the NYC Environmental Justice Alliance and the The Nature Conservancy’s NY Cities Program as part of the Just Nature NYC partnership. From the Layer Properties - Symbology menu, users can go to the “Style” button near the bottom, select “Load Style” and set the File to use as vegmapping_style_qgis_tutorial.qml and click “Load Style.”\n\nFrom there, simply clicking “Apply” or “OK” should yield a map that looks like the below, where the transition from yellow to green happens at the 0.32 mark, which is the proportion of land area within a 200 meter radius area that needs to be covered by vegetation to start reducing air temperatures, based on research led by the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene.\n\n\n\nVegetation Density dataset with a yellow-greens gradient applied based on a custom style loaded form a .qml file\n\n\n\n\n3.4.3 Basemaps\nIn QGIS there are a few different ways to bring in basemaps. Users familiar with different web services (e.g., WMS/WMTS, ArcGIS REST services, etc.) can specify those through the Data Source Manager or the Browser panel, but more simply, for many use cases, users can use the QuickMapServices plugin. If it is not already up, you can click the  on the toolbar. From there, in the SearchQMS panel, users can search for various basemaps, such as from Google. Note, these are not necessarily licensed openly for broad reuse, but for visualizing datasets together, this can still be useful! Additionally, if you search for “nyc.gov” you can find basemaps, labels, and imagery specific to NYC from the City of New York, and acceptable for use in various ways under a Creative Commons license - see the associated website. To load a given basemap into QGIS, users can double-click an entry, or click the “Add” button; the layers get added to the bottom of the list of layers in the Layers panel.\n\n\n\nExample of the Green Roof Centroid data mapped over a basemap"

Each pixel represents a 100 foot by 100 foot area on the ground. The data are available on a data repository, Zenodo.\n\nCommunity District Boundaries - nycd.shp:\n\na vector dataset of (multi)polygons representing the 59 Community Districts in NYC, each of which has an associated Community Board NYC Department of City Planning Website. The version available here was the version already clipped to shorelines, and associated with NYC Department of City Planning release “23D.”\n\nNote, this dataset is a shapefile, which involves not only the .shp. file but a number of other, “sidecar” files. For the shapefile to work correctly, all of the other associated files must be kept with it, in the same folder.\n\n\nNYC Heat Vulnerability Index by Community District (2023) - NYC EH Data Portal - Heat vulnerability index (full table).csv:\n\nThe NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene produces this dataset to represent the risk of community-level heat impacts, like deaths, due to extreme heat events. The data and additional information are available from the NYC Environment and Health Data Portal\n\nTree Canopy and Street Tree Summary Data - canopy_streettree_supp.gpkg:\n\nThis file includes data on tree canopy change (2010-2017) and street trees aggregated to political and administrative units of Boroughs, Community Districts, City Council Districts (2010), and Neighborhood Tabulation Areas (2010).\n\nGreen Roof Data (Centroids) for NYC - GreenRoofData2016_20180917.csv:\n\nComma separated values file with the only spatial data for the green roofs being coordinates for the centroids in columns of xcoord and ycoord. The original dataset, along with more complete spatial data (green roof footprints) and full information about it is available on Zenodo.\n\nNYS Disadvantaged Communities 2023 - Final_DAC_Attributes.shp:\n\nShapefile with a dataset developed by the New York State Climate Justice Working Group, identifying areas with “disadvantaged communities to ensure that frontline and otherwise underserved communities benefit from the state’s historic transition to cleaner, greener sources of energy, reduced pollution and cleaner air, and economic opportunities.” The data, based on Census Tract polygons, along with documentation and an interactive map is available from a New York State Government website.\n\nNote, this dataset is a shapefile, which involves not only the .shp. file but a number of other, “sidecar” files. For the shapefile to work correctly, all of the other associated files must be kept with it, in the same folder.\n\n\n\n\n2.1.1 A note about data in .zip files in QGIS\nIn many cases, data are made available in a compressed, .zip format - this tends to particularly hold true when multiple files are shared together, either for functionality (e.g., with shapefiles and the associated sidecar files), or to ensure metadata stays with the associated data files. For many software packages, to even use the data in these files, they need to be “extracted” from the .zip format, and this functionality is generally included in a given operating system, third party tools (e.g., free and open source 7-zip). And for working with the tutorial, it is recommended that you do unzip the main folder of data made available.\nHowever, it is possible to work with data in read-only mode (i.e., edits to datasets downloaded cannot be made) - and this is often a good use case for spatial data processing, in which edits files involves writing out new data files. Thus, for working with the tutorial data, you can opt to leave any data in .zip files as they are. If you find that viewing or working with the data is slow, you may try unzipping the files to see if it makes a difference, but some benefits I see of working with the .zip files are:\n\nKeeping the “raw” or “source” data for a project uneditable in the .zip format helps ensure you can always go back to that original dataset if needed.\nBy not unzipping the data, you can reduce the storage space required for your project on your hard drive, since uncompressing may increase the size, and unless you delete the compressed files, there will be somewhat duplicate files on your drive. This can also help users keep data a bit better organized, simply because of the fewer folders and files.\n\nThis functionality in QGIS to work with uncompressed data (among other things), made possible by the Geospatial Data Abstraction Library (GDAL), in implementation of virtual file systems."

    "section": "3.2 Importing Data in Delimited Text (e.g., CSV) Files",
    "text": "3.2 Importing Data in Delimited Text (e.g., CSV) Files\nIn many cases data are found in non-GIS data formats, such as .csv files, which can be read into spreadsheet software such as Excel. Spatial data in these files may be in the form of columns representing x and y coordinates (for points) or in a single column with the information stored in a “WKT” or “Well-Known Text” format, which follows a specific convention for spatial information (this can include data for (multi) points, lines, and polygons data).\nThe process for importing these datasets is inherently not as simple as drag-and-drop, due to the fact that these files do not contain all of the information GIS software would need to display them correctly - some of it must be provided (or confirmed) by the user.\nAs an example, the data associated with this tutorial include a CSV file with centroids of green roofs in NYC. One workflow for bringing this dataset into QGIS is as follows:\n\nOpen the Data Source Manager ( - generally near the upper left in the toolbar; it is also available through CTRL+L on Windows and the Layers menu)\nSelect the Delimited Text option on the left, use the “…” to the right of the File name box box at the top to navigate to the file.\n\nIn this case, QGIS should automatically identify that it is a CSV file, and that the data are point coordinates, with the x- and y-fields being stored in the data in columns xcoord and ycoord, respectively. Users should always confirm QGIS is identifying such information correct.\nQGIS does not know what the CRS, or Coordinate Reference System is for these data, so the “Geometry CRS” entry says may either make an assumption, that it is in the same CRS as other data brought into QGIS already, or it will indicate “invalid projection” and this needs to be specified by the user. \n\nIn either case for this dataset, you will need to indicate to QGIS the correct CRS. The previous dataset we have brought in by this point was in the New York State Plane Long Island Zone, North American Datum of 1983, EPSG 2263, in US Feet. However, this dataset has the coordinates in Latitude/Longitude, in the WGS 84 Datum, EPSG 4326. Click on the icon to the right of this box about Coordinate Systems \n\nThen in the window that appears, use the text filter to search for ‘4326’ - which is a shorthand reference, an “EPSG” code to the appropriate Coordinate Reference System these coordinates are in - (More about Coordinate Reference Systems in the next chapter, Coordinate Reference Systems.) Expand the content in the next box, to reflect what you see in the screenshot below, and hit the Okay button. \nIn the Data Source Manager, you should now be able to click the “Add” button (which would have been grayed out until the CRS is defined).\n\nBefore the dataset appears in the Layers panel, and the points appear in the main window of QGIS, you may see a window pop up asking you to select the desired operations to convert between coordinate systems. You can simply go with the default option and click “OK.”\n\n\nThe data layer, layered on top of the other dataset we have brought in at this point should now appear something like the below (you’ll need to close out the Data Source Manager window). \n\n** At this point, load in each of the other data layers (except for other layers available with the Tree Canopy and Street Tree Summary data - for that, the Community District layer is the only one you’ll need). For the remaining datasets you can drag and drop from your file explorer or by navigating to them in the Browser panel; if the data are in .zip folders, you can use those. The NYC Heat Vulnerability Index data is a tabular data, and will not show anything in the main QGIS window, but we will use it later on.* \n\n3.2.1 Ordering and Grouping Layers\nAs the data layers were loaded, they generally should be listed in the Layers panel, in the order in which they were loaded (last layer at the bottom). This also reflects the ordering in the main map area, or the canvas - with the layers higher in the list being “on top” visually (i.e., the dataset of green roof points should be visible on top of everything else and you may not see some layers that are hidden behind or below others).\nTo change which layers are visible, you can use the check-boxes, to make them appear or disappear in the map canvas, and you can re-order in the Layers panel by clicking and holding on the desired layer, and moving it up or down with respect to the other layers.\nSometimes it is helpful to “group” layers - which has them nested under a title within the Layers panel, and then they, as a group, appear above or below the other layers based on the ordering within the panel. There will also be a check-box next to the group label, which you can use to turn on or off those layers together. To group/ungroup, select the desired layers by using CTRL + Click on each layer (or SHIFT + Click on the first and last layer if all consecutively ordered), right click, and select “Group Selected.”\n\n\n\nGrouping layers by selecting the desired layers in the Layers panel and right-clicking\n\n\nYou can then move layers into and out of the group by clicking/dragging them around. You can also create a new group using the respective icon at the top of the Layers panel  and then drag layers in and out as desired.\n\n\n\nExample of grouped layers in the Layers panel\n\n\nUpon creating a group, you can rename it by right clicking on it and selecting “Rename Group.” Similarly, you can rename layers for use in the QGIS project by right clicking on them and selecting “Rename Layer.”\n\n\n3.2.2 Saving a Project\nAt this point, we’ve done a few different steps, and as with so much work, would not want to have to redo things we’ve already done if anything happens - the computer or software crashes. To do this the first time, you can click the  on the toolbar, navigate to the desired folder where you want to save the project, set a name, and click “Save.”\nThe default format is a .qgz file, which is suitable for most use cases. If you are working on a shared drive with others, you may opt to use the .qgs format, which at least in my experience, works better if multiple people may be opening the project from different user accounts (e.g., on a server).\nAs you work, you can click the  or use CTRL + S on the keyboard to save as you go.\nYou can also save an existing project into a new file by using the Project menu and selecting “Save As” or using CTRL + SHIFT + S on the keyboard."

    "section": "4.1 Checking and Setting Project and Layer CRS",
    "text": "4.1 Checking and Setting Project and Layer CRS\nQGIS automatically reads Coordinate Reference System information, if available, from data layers. For shapefiles, it generally relies on the .prj sidecar file; for most other vector formats and raster data, it is generally embedded in the file. If you load data without built-in projection information (e.g., a Delimited Text File), it generally assumes a geographic coordinate system - either Latitude/Longitude in the WGS 84 datum (EPSG 4326) or the Project CRS, generally defined based on the first dataset loaded for a project unless otherwise specified by the user.\nTo see what the Project CRS is, you can check the bottom-right corner of the main QGIS window and it will indicate next the  - you can click . Alternatively, go to the Project menu at the top of the QGIS window, select Project Properties and then select the CRS tab on the side. In the tutorial project I set up for myself in working through this tutorial, the Project CRS is NAD83 / New York Long Island (ftUS), with a shorthand code, the EPSG code, being 2263 (EPSG 2263). For the data in this tutorial, this is a good, locally-appropriate CRS.\n\n\n\nExample of looking at the Coordinate Reference System for a project, showing in this case, the Project CRS is NAD83 / New York Long Island (ftUS), EPSG 2263. Clicking on the area circled in Purple in the main QGIS window is a shortcut to get to the Project Properties - CRS window, shown here in the foreground.\n\n\nTo check what CRS QGIS is using for a layer, the quickest way is to right-click on a layer, and hover over “Layer CRS” - the top item in what appears is the CRS that QGIS is using. From here, users can change the Project CRS to that of the layer, or change it. Note, “setting” the layer CRS is simply telling QGIS how to interpret the coordinates associated with the spatial data. If the data are not actually in the CRS being assigned, things will not appear to be in the right places.\n\n\n\nChecking the layer CRS for the Green Roof Centroid data\n\n\n\n4.1.1 On the Fly Projection\nQGIS and most other GIS software has what is called On the Fly Projection meaning that data do not need to be in the same CRS to be viewed together in the correct place. Basically, the necessary mathematical transformations are conducted by the software as needed to support visualizing all of the data together. To see what things might look like if this was not the case, you can go to the Project CRS information as shown above, and check the box at the top for “No CRS (or unknown/non-earth projection)” and then use the  in the toolbar to zoom to the full extent all of the layers at once. What you see will likely look very zoomed out, and you will see some data, quite small, and far apart from one-another, and maybe not see others because they are so small when plotted on common units, rather than re-projected on the fly so everything lines up.\nTo get back to how things were, go back to the Project CRS, uncheck the box you just checked, select the appropriate CRS (EPSG 2263 in this case), and click “OK.”"

    "text": "4.2 Transforming to a Different CRS - Vector Data\nPer the note at the beginning of this section, data layers should generally be in the same CRS for spatial processing operations (any way in which you are using the data together, spatially, beyond visualization). While EPSG 2263 is a generally suitable CRS for work in NYC, not all of the layers shared with this tutorial are in this CRS; in particular, the following are in different CRSs - Green Roof Centroids data (in Latitude/Longitude coordinates according to the WGS84 datum) and the Disadvantaged Communities Data (in UTM zone), thus they should be transformed to align with the CRS of the other layers.\nIn QGIS transform vector to a different CRS, or “reprojecting” the data is generally done through an export operation, where the spatial data are transformed to in the process of the export. To start, right-click on a layer, navigate to “Export” and select “Save Features As.”\n\n\n\nNavigating to vector layer export menu\n\n\nIn the menu that pops up, you can chose from different formats; in this case I will select GeoPackage (.gpkg extension), an open standard format that can have multiple layers within a single file. For my tutorial project, I’ll create a single where I will save my outputs. You can set the destination file location and name for the GeoPackage file, and specify the layer name, which will default to the same name as the original. For work like this, I tend to adjust the layer name to reflect the important change, and I add “_epsg2263” to the end of the default. Then, most importantly, for CRS, you should be able to select EPSG:2263 from the dropdown menu for CRS, but if you don’t, you can search for it and select it via the  icon to the right of that. From there, generally the defaults for the export can be left as-is, leave the box checked at the bottom to “Add saved file to map” and click “OK.”\n\n\n\nSample dialogue box for exporting the Green Roof Centroid data while transforming the data to the desired CRS\n\n\nBefore proceeding in this tutorial, please reproject the Disadvantaged Communities dataset\nSome notes for after export:\n\nWhen the layer is loaded upon export, the default name for GeoPackage layers can be rather long, thus you may wish to rename to a shorter but intuitive name;\nAs data are exported and re-imported, the layer styling is lost. Thus, you may wish to right click on the original layer, navigate to copy the layer styles, and then paste them to the new, reprojected version;\nWith the new version of the layer loaded, you may want to remove the old version - you can do this by clicking on it and then using the  icon at the top of the Layers panel, or by right-clicking on the layer and selecting “Remove Layer.”"
